description: Set up SSH key authentication so a host stops asking for a password, and manage the keys involved. Use when the user configures a new server with a password, says they are tired of typing a password, asks about ssh-copy-id, ssh-keygen, "install my key", "passwordless login", "authorized_keys", or when a login fails because a key is missing or not accepted. Also covers what has to be installed for any of this to work, which on every platform is nothing.

# Key-based login

A password in a config file is a password on disk, and typing one into every
session is friction. A key fixes both. The whole switch is one tool call.

## It usually happens by itself

A profile configured with only a password upgrades itself on first use: the
first tool that connects installs a key, verifies it, and **removes the
password from the config**. Nothing needs to be called for this, and the tool
output reports it. Say so when relaying that output - the user should know
their password is no longer stored and where the key went.

If the upgrade failed, the note explains why and the password is still in
place. That is worth surfacing rather than glossing over: it means the host
refused key authentication, and the password is still on disk.

`autoKey: false` on `ssh_setup` turns the automatic switch off for hosts where
it is not wanted.

## Doing it by hand

1. `ssh_setup` with host, user and the password.
2. `ssh_authorize` on that profile.

`ssh_authorize` does what `ssh-copy-id` does: it generates an ed25519 key if
the profile has none, appends the public key to the remote
`~/.ssh/authorized_keys` with the permissions sshd insists on, points the
profile at the new key, and then **opens a second connection using only the
key** to prove it works before claiming success.

Report the fingerprint and whether verification succeeded. If it did not, say
so plainly - the key is installed but something is rejecting it, and the
password is still there as a fallback.

## What has to be installed

Nothing. Not `ssh`, not `ssh-keygen`, not `ssh-copy-id`. The SSH protocol is
implemented in JavaScript and keys are generated with Node's own crypto, so
Windows, macOS and Linux behave identically. If a user asks what to install,
run `ssh_doctor` and show them the report rather than guessing.

The keys produced are ordinary OpenSSH ed25519 keys, so `ssh -i` and any other
SSH client can use the same file.

On Windows there is one caveat worth passing on: the owner-only file modes
this extension sets are not enforced there, because access is governed by
ACLs. That makes replacing a stored password with a key more valuable, not
less. `ssh_doctor` says so on that platform.

## Things worth getting right

- **Never overwrite an existing key.** Every host that already trusts it would
  stop accepting it. `ssh_authorize` reuses a key at the given path; `ssh_keygen`
  refuses to replace one unless explicitly told to.
- **Keep the password until the key is proven.** `ssh_authorize` leaves it in
  the profile by default. Only pass `removePassword: true` once verification
  has succeeded, and prefer to ask the user first: if `authorized_keys` is ever
  reset, that password is the way back in.
- **One key per host is a reasonable default.** The default path is
  `~/.ssh/id_ed25519_pi_<profile>`, which keeps a compromise contained to one
  host. Pass `keyPath` to reuse an existing key across hosts if the user wants
  that.
- **A passphrase-protected key cannot be bootstrapped.** If the user points at
  one, this flow cannot read it; either use a different key path or configure
  the passphrase in the profile.

## If the key is not accepted afterwards

The usual causes, in order:

1. Permissions. sshd silently ignores `~/.ssh` or `authorized_keys` if they are
   group- or world-writable. `ssh_exec` with `ls -ld ~/.ssh ~/.ssh/authorized_keys`
   shows it; 700 and 600 are what is wanted.
2. The account's home is not where you think - a different `AuthorizedKeysFile`
   in `sshd_config`, or a chrooted account. `ssh_authorize` takes an
   `authorizedKeysPath` for that case.
3. The server does not allow public key auth at all (`PubkeyAuthentication no`),
   which needs a change on the server side.

## Keys without a host

`ssh_keygen` just makes a key pair and prints the public key, for cases where
the user installs it themselves - a cloud provider's web console, a deploy key
in a Git host, a colleague who will add it for them.
